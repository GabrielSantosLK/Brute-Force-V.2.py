➡️ What does he do?: Basically you put the target G-mail and it tries to log in with all the passwords of your Word-List. Before using it, save your Word-List on your Desktop as a list.txt; I have a slight problem in the program which is that, the Program only works if the target E-mail is with the Login option with Unknown App ON; I tested with some "friends", some of them were with ON option. I made a Word of its own for each one, and it worked. I will be updating the Program, so you do not need to have this option ON.
